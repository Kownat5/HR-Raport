Finished my next project that shows diffrent HR statistics in "average" company. 
I made the dashboard in Power Bi, cleaned and extracted data in SQL (MySQL). 
Dashboard contains two pages that shows all kind of information.
In my Github repository you can download PDF with 2 page dashboard, Power BI file, SQL files with step by step data cleaning and data extraction (Questions).
I also made .txt files with SQL scripts that are in SQL files.
Hope You'll enjoy.

PS. My next project is going to be also in Power BI but this time I'm going to use Python (that I'm currently learning) to clean and extract data.
